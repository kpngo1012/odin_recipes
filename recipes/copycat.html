    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      I tried to make a copycat Popeyes fried chicken sandwich and ended up with
      a hybrid between that and the one from Chick-fil-A. So you get the best of
      both worlds and what's more, this DIY version never runs out, not even on
      Sundays.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>Marinade</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
      <li>1 dash hot sauce, or to taste</li>
      <li>
        1 tablespoon dry ranch dressing mix (such as Hidden Valley Ranch®)
      </li>
      <li>4 (5 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Breading</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1 ⅓ cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 ½ teaspoons cayenne pepper (Optional)</li>
      <li>
        1 tablespoon dry ranch dressing mix (such as Hidden Valley Ranch®)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Wash:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
      <li>½ cup buttermilk</li>
      <li>¼ cup milk</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>The Rest:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>canola oil for frying</li>
      <li>4 soft hamburger buns, toasted and buttered</li>
      <li>6 tablespoons mayonnaise, or to taste</li>
      <li>12 dill pickle slices, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Whisk buttermilk, salt, hot sauce, and ranch dressing mix together in a
        large bowl. Cut diagonal slits into the thick ends of chicken breasts
        and toss into marinade until well coated. Transfer to the refrigerator
        to marinate for 2 to 4 hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, make the breading: Mix flour, cornstarch, salt, pepper,
        cayenne, and ranch dressing mix together in a shallow dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make the wash: Whisk egg, buttermilk, and milk together in another bowl
        until combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use a fork to pull chicken from marinade, letting any excess drip off.
        Dip into the breading to coat both sides; shake off any excess. Dip into
        egg wash mixture to saturate surface; return to breading to coat, shake
        off excess, and repeat once more. Let sit on a wire rack to dry, at
        least 15 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a deep-fryer to between 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and
        375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Fry chicken breasts in the hot oil until golden, crispy, and no longer
        pink in the centers, 4 to 5 minutes, flipping halfway through. Transfer
        to a plate topped with crinkled up aluminum foil to prevent bottoms from
        getting soggy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread mayonnaise over hamburger bun halves. Stuff with pickles and
        chicken.
      </li>
    </ol>
